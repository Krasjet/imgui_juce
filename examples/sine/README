sine
====

A barebone sine oscillator using ImGui for GUI.

No parameter smoothing is applied, so don't use this plugin
in production, but it should demonstrate how to use the
library.

Dependencies
------------

Make sure git and CMake are installed on your system. JUCE
and ImGui will be fetched and patched automatically by CMake
using FetchContent.

Build
-----

Run

    $ cmake -B build
    $ cd build
    $ make

Alternatively, use Ninja (or your own build system)

    $ cmake -B build -G Ninja
    $ cd build
    $ ninja

which is probably faster than default make.

On Linux, the standalone program is located at

    ./build/sine_artefacts/Standalone/Sine

and the VST3 plugin is located at

    ./build/sine_artefacts/VST3/Sine.vst3
