sine
====

A barebone sine oscillator VST3 plugin using ImGui for GUI.

No parameter smoothing is applied, so don't use this plugin
in production, but it should demonstrate how to use the
library.

Dependencies
------------

Make sure git and CMake are installed on your system. JUCE
and ImGui will be fetched and patched automatically by CMake
using FetchContent.

Build (Linux/macOS)
-------------------

Run

    $ cmake -B build
    $ cd build
    $ make

Alternatively, use Ninja (or your own build system)

    $ cmake -B build -G Ninja
    $ cd build
    $ ninja

which is probably faster than default make.

The standalone program is located at

    ./build/sine_artefacts/Standalone/Sine

and the VST3 plugin is located at

    ./build/sine_artefacts/VST3/Sine.vst3

Build (Windows, MSVC)
---------------------

Open x64 Native Tools Command Prompt (or x64_86 etc.)
included with Visual Studio

    $ cmake -B build
    $ cd build
    $ msbuild app.sln

You might want to use the `/property:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo`
flag with msbuild to change the build type.

The standalone program is located at

    .\build\sine_artefacts\Debug\Standalone\Sine.exe

and the VST3 plugin is located at

    .\build\sine_artefacts\Debug\VST3\Sine.vst3
