hidpi
=====

Minimal working example for GUI application with HiDPI
support.

Notice that a custom font is used here because the default
pixel font of ImGui only looks good on integer multiples of
the base 13px font size.

Dependencies
------------

Make sure git and CMake are installed on your system. JUCE
and ImGui will be fetched automatically by CMake using
FetchContent.

Build
-----

Run

    $ cmake -B build
    $ cd build
    $ make

Alternatively, use Ninja (or your own build system)

    $ cmake -B build -G Ninja
    $ cd build
    $ ninja

which is probably faster than default make.

On Linux, the compiled application is located at

    ./build/hidpi_artefacts/hidpi
