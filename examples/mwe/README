mwe
===

Minimal working example for GUI application.

Dependencies
------------

Make sure git and CMake are installed on your system. JUCE
and ImGui will be fetched automatically by CMake using
FetchContent.

Build (Linux/macOS)
-------------------

Run

    $ cmake -B build
    $ cd build
    $ make

Alternatively, use Ninja (or your own build system)

    $ cmake -B build -G Ninja
    $ cd build
    $ ninja

which is probably faster than default make.

The compiled application is located at

    ./build/mwe_artefacts/mwe

Build (Windows, MSVC)
---------------------

Open x64 Native Tools Command Prompt (or x64_86 etc.)
included with Visual Studio

    $ cmake -B build
    $ cd build
    $ msbuild app.sln

You might want to use the `/property:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo`
flag with msbuild to change the build type.

The compiled application is located at

    .\build\mwe_artefacts\Debug\Standalone\mwe.exe

or similar locations if a different build type is used.
