=====

A simple oscilloscope VST3 plugin using ImPlot.

Dependencies
------------

Make sure git and CMake are installed on your system. JUCE,
ImGui, and ImPlot will be fetched and patched automatically
by CMake using FetchContent.

Build (Linux/macOS)
-------------------

Run

    $ cmake -B build
    $ cd build
    $ make

Alternatively, use Ninja (or your own build system)

    $ cmake -B build -G Ninja
    $ cd build
    $ ninja

which is probably faster than default make.

The standalone program is located at

    ./build/scope_artefacts/Standalone/Scope

and the VST3 plugin is located at

    ./build/scope_artefacts/VST3/Scope.vst3

Build (Windows, MSVC)
---------------------

Open x64 Native Tools Command Prompt (or x64_86 etc.)
included with Visual Studio

    $ cmake -B build
    $ cd build
    $ msbuild app.sln

You might want to use the `/property:Configuration=RelWithDebInfo`
flag with msbuild to change the build type.

The standalone program is located at

    .\build\scope_artefacts\Debug\Standalone\Scope.exe

and the VST3 plugin is located at

    .\build\scope_artefacts\Debug\VST3\Scope.vst3
