A simple oscilloscope VST3 plugin using ImPlot.

Dependencies
------------

Make sure git and CMake are installed on your system. JUCE,
ImGui, and ImPlot will be fetched and patched automatically
by CMake using FetchContent.

Build
-----

Run

    $ cmake -B build
    $ cd build
    $ make

Alternatively, use Ninja (or your own build system)

    $ cmake -B build -G Ninja
    $ cd build
    $ ninja

which is probably faster than default make.

On Linux, the standalone program is located at

    ./build/scope_artefacts/Standalone/Scope

and the VST3 plugin is located at

    ./build/scope_artefacts/VST3/Scope.vst3
